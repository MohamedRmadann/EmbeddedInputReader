<h1>Embedded Voltmeter</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project involves using a Raspberry Pi Pico to read analog inputs from various sensors, convert them into digital values via the ADC, and display the results on a four-digit seven-segment display. The process is initiated by a button press, managed with an edge-triggered interrupt and debouncing techniques to ensure accuracy. A timer periodically updates the display, ensuring real-time data is shown without flickering. The project highlights skills in breadboard assembly, ADC conversion, and button handling.
